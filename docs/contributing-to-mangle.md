## We are glad that you are interested in contributing...

The Mangle project team welcomes contributions from the community. We are always thrilled to receive [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request), and do our best to process them as fast as we can.If you wish to contribute code, you should sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/vmware/mangle/blob/master/assets/files/vmware_cla.pdf) and return a copy to [OSS Contributions](mailto:osscontributions@vmware.com) before we can merge your contribution.For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq).

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [Github issue](https://github.com/vmware/mangle/issues) or discuss it first with the official project maintainers via [team chat](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa0fe7cfcd9bc451b8a5b1fc60302cc8e%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=34804802-7ffb-4f9a-8e7a-95b9c7ce305a&tenantId=b39138ca-3cee-4b4a-a4d6-cd83d9dd62f0), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.
